# Test Cases

Total 12 Javascript testcases.  
-> 7 test cases for AdminPanel (adminPanel.test.js)  
-> 5 test cases for BountyHub (bountyHub.test.js)  

Tests can be run using the command `truffle test` after navigating to the project directory.  

Test cases were written to test primary functionality of both contracts. Initially some tests were failing. Upon further inspection some minor issues were found, which were rectified.
